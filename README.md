# Human and Dog and Cat Face Recognition Model

This project aims to develop a robust model for human, dog, and cat face recognition using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify faces of humans, dogs, and cats with high accuracy.

## Features

- Face Detection: The model can accurately detect and locate human, dog, and cat faces in images or video frames.
- Face Classification: It can classify the detected faces into appropriate categories: human, dog, or cat.
- Multi-Class Recognition: The model can handle images or video frames containing multiple faces and classify each face accordingly.
- High Accuracy: The deep learning architecture employed ensures high accuracy in recognizing and classifying faces.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language, leveraging its extensive libraries and frameworks for deep learning.
- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is used as the primary deep learning framework for training and deploying the face recognition model.
- OpenCV: OpenCV is utilized for image processing tasks, including face detection and preprocessing.
- CNN Architecture: The model is built using a convolutional neural network architecture, specifically designed for recognizing and classifying human, dog, and cat faces.


## Usage

1. Prepare the input data: Ensure the images or video frames containing human, dog, and cat faces are available in the specified input directory.

2. Configure the model: Adjust the model parameters, such as confidence thresholds or network architecture, if necessary, in the configuration file.

3. Run the project: Execute the main.py script to initiate the face recognition process.

4. Analyze the results: The model will detect and classify the faces, and the results will be displayed or saved based on the specified configurations.
